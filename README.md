# AngularWebAPI
Angular and Web API with Entity FrameWork
NewFolder.Zip contains the Angular Project.
I have removed Node modules in AngularUI Project and Packages from AngularAPI project to reduce project size.
From Visual Studio Code click Open Folder and select AngularUI folder, then open terminal and run command "npm install" which will install all required node modules.
Then run command "npm start" to run the application.
Open the AngularAPI project using visual studio 2017 and build the application to restore the packages.
